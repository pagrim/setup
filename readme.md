# Setup
This is a set of scripts to build my own preferred setup on MacOs, including:
* Bash setup
* Git setup
* Range of preferred tools

I'm interested to hear if it's useful to anyone or if anyone sees improvements.

# Usage
* Clone this repo
* Add your github personal access token into the `.bash_profile` file
* Run the `setup.sh` script, passing your name and email `. setup.sh "Joe Bloggs" joe@bloggs.com`
